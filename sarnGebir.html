                Sarn Gebir, known as the Sarn Ford in the Common Speech, is a treacherous stretch along the Great River Anduin, marked by sharp rocks and swift currents. This perilous area is notorious among travelers for its rapids, which pose a significant danger to anyone attempting to navigate the river. As the Fellowship of the Ring journeyed southward, they were forced to portage their boats around these rapids under the cover of darkness, narrowly avoiding an ambush by Orc archers lying in wait. The rugged nature of Sarn Gebir not only highlights the physical challenges faced by the Fellowship but also underscores the constant vigilance required to evade the ever-present threats of Middle-earth.            </p>
