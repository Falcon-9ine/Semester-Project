                The Mines of Moria, once the grandest of Dwarven kingdoms under the mountain, now stand as a haunting testament to the perils of greed and the relentless pursuit of wealth. Known as Khazad-dûm, this vast underground city is a labyrinth of majestic halls, deep wells, and echoing chambers, now fallen into darkness and ruin. It was here that the Fellowship faced one of their most dire challenges: the Balrog of Moria, a fearsome demon of fire and shadow that dwelt deep within the forgotten depths. The encounter culminated in the legendary battle where Gandalf the Grey confronted the creature on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, a momentous event that led to his fall and subsequent rebirth as Gandalf the White.
