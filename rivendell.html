                Rivendell, also known as the Last Homely House east of the sea, is a serene refuge nestled in the deep, hidden clefts of the Misty Mountains. This elven haven, founded by Lord Elrond, is celebrated for its beauty and the wisdom of its inhabitants. Sheltered from the outside world by towering cliffs and enchanting waterfalls, Rivendell is a place of peace and learning, holding vast libraries with ancient lore. It serves as a crucial meeting point for many pivotal events in Middle-earth, offering counsel and sanctuary to those seeking respite from the dark forces that roam beyond its borders.
